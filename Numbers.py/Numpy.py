
# ðŸ”¹ What is NumPy?
# NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

# It is a Python library that helps us do math with big numbers easily and quickly.

# Normally, Python lists are slow when doing calculations, but NumPy makes them much faster.

# ðŸ”¹ What Can NumPy Do?
# âœ… Create arrays (special lists that store numbers).
# âœ… Do math operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) quickly.
# âœ… Handle large data efficiently.

# ðŸ”¹ What is an Array?
# An array is like a special list of numbers, but faster and more powerful.

# Example:

import numpy as np  # Import NumPy and call it "np"

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Create an array
print(arr)  # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]
# âœ… Key Difference:

# Python List: Can hold different types (numbers, words, etc.).

# NumPy Array: Holds only one type (all numbers must be the same type).

# âœ… Why Use NumPy Instead of Lists?

# Faster ðŸš€

# Uses less memory

# More powerful for math operations
