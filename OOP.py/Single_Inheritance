# Single Inheritance (One Parent, One Child)
# The child class inherits from a single parent class.

# Just like a son inheriting his dad’s surname.

# Example:

class Parent:  
    def home(self):  
        print("This is my house")  

class Child(Parent):  
    def bike(self):  
        print("I have a bike")  

c = Child()  
c.home()  # Inherited from Parent  
c.bike()  # Own method  
# ✅ The child inherits the home() function from the parent!
