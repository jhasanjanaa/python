# Multiple Inheritance (One Child, Two Parents)
# The child class gets features from two parents.

# Just like a kid getting features from both mom and dad!

# Example:

class Mom:  
    def cooking(self):  
        print("Mom can cook")  

class Dad:  
    def driving(self):  
        print("Dad can drive")  

class Child(Mom, Dad):  
    def playing(self):  
        print("I can play")  

c = Child()  
c.cooking()  # From Mom  
c.driving()  # From Dad  
c.playing()  # Own method  
# âœ… The child inherits from both Mom and Dad!
