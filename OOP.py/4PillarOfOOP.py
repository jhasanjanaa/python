# FOUR PILLARS OF OBJECT ORIENTATION PROGRAMMING:

# The four pillars of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** are:
'''
The 4 pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in the simplest way:

Encapsulation (Data Hiding) â†’ Keep data safe inside a class and allow access only through specific functions.
ðŸ”¹ Example: A bank account only allows deposits and withdrawals, but you can't directly change the balance.

Abstraction (Hiding Complexity) â†’ Show only what's necessary, hide the details.
ðŸ”¹ Example: You use a mobile phone to call, but you don't see how it works inside.

Inheritance (Reusing Features) â†’ A new class inherits features from an old class.
ðŸ”¹ Example: A baby gets eye color from parents.

Polymorphism (One Name, Many Uses) â†’ The same function works differently for different things.
ðŸ”¹ Example: The word "run" means running on foot, running a program, or running a business.
