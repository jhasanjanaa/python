# Multilevel Inheritance (Grandpa → Dad → Son)
# A child inherits from a parent, and then another child inherits from that child!

# Like Grandfather → Father → Son.

# Example:

class Grandpa:  
    def wisdom(self):  
        print("I have experience")  

class Dad(Grandpa):  
    def work(self):  
        print("I have a job")  

class Son(Dad):  
    def gaming(self):  
        print("I love gaming")  

s = Son()  
s.wisdom()  # Inherited from Grandpa  
s.work()    # Inherited from Dad  
s.gaming()  # Own method  
# ✅ Son inherits from Dad, and Dad inherits from Grandpa!
